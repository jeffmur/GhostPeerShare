Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) schemes allow computations over encrypted data without access to the decryption key. Microsoft's Simple Encryption Arithmetic Library (SEAL) provides a state-of-the-art C++ library that enables addition, subtraction, and multiplication on encrypted integers or real numbers. SEAL is difficult to implement on Android due to its outdated documentation. Furthermore, it requires expertise in C++, Kotlin, and Gradle.
This project presents a natively compiled Dart plugin that abstracts the underlying C/C++ library. The FHE Library plugin enables developers to access SEAL's full functionality within other Dart plugins and Flutter applications.
To evaluate the versatility of the plugin, we employ two implementations: 1) the Distance Measure Dart plugin and 2) the GhostPeerShare Flutter application. The Distance Measure plugin implements Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Bhattacharyya Coefficient, and Cramer Distance, along with their FHE counterparts. GhostPeerShare adapts the implementation from Proof of Presence Share (Pop-Share), a mobile application that can detect similar videos using FHE. 
GhostPeerShare achieved a precision score of 0.9614 and an F1 score of 0.9709 for identifying similar videos. Although video pre-processing was considerably slower, the average FHE computation of each distance measure matched that of Pop-Share.
These results demonstrate that GhostPeerShare represents a significant advance in the accessibility of FHE within the mobile community.
