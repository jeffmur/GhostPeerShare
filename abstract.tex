The Microsoft Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) lacks modern support for mobile devices, limiting accessibility and adoption within the cross-platform development community. To address this challenge, the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library Plugin in Dart introduces a flexible, modular interface, enabling developers and security researchers to integrate SEAL seamlessly within the new or existing Flutter applications. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of this solution, we apply evaluation criteria from previous work in this area, to serve as our baseline. We compare the variance in score derivation using the same video input, train a supervised artificial neural network to predict similarity scores, and perform an exhaustive performance test on each stage of the Flutter application. The result builds upon the findings of Pop-Share, achieving 98.05\% accuracy in detecting similarity between videos without revealing the content, using Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Bhattacharyya Coefficient (BC), and Cramerâ€™s Distance (CD). Compared to our baseline, our implementation of CD showed no variance and KLD demonstrated reduced variability, with a standard deviation of 0.15, as our baseline was 0.24. However, the average computation time of Fully Homomorphic operations was 400ms slower than the baseline.
