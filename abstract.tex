This paper presents advancements in the integration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) within mobile applications through the development of the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (FHEL) Plugin and the Distance Measure Plugin for Flutter. By leveraging Microsoft SEAL, we demonstrate high performance and responsiveness for encrypted computations on mobile devices, addressing the need for privacy and security in mobile software development. Our results indicate high accuracy and consistency in deriving video similarity scores using Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Bhattacharyya Coefficient, and Cramerâ€™s Distance, facilitating effective secure data exchange. This work opens pathways for future applications of FHE, particularly in critical areas such as medical devices, enabling secure interactions between mobile applications and encrypted data from cloud service providers. Ultimately, our findings highlight the potential of FHE to enhance user privacy and security in modern mobile applications, laying the groundwork for future innovations in this field.
