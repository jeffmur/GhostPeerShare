                   services are experiencing greater popularity. Aside from
                   providing storage, photo sharing services enable
                   bandwidth-efficient downloads to mobile devices by
                   performing server-side image transformations (resizing,
                   cropping). On the flip side, photo sharing services have
                   raised privacy concerns such as leakage of photos to
                   unauthorized viewers and the use of algorithmic recognition
                   technologies by providers. To address these concerns, we
                   propose a privacy-preserving photo encoding algorithm that
                   extracts and encrypts a small, but significant, component of
                   the photo, while preserving the remainder in a public,
                   standards-compatible, part. These two components can be
                   separately stored. This technique significantly reduces the
                   signal-to-noise ratio and the accuracy of automated
                   detection and recognition on the public part, while
                   preserving the ability of the provider to perform
                   server-side transformations to conserve download bandwidth
                   usage. Our prototype privacy-preserving photo sharing
                   system, P3, works with Facebook, and can be extended to
                   other services as well. P3 requires no changes to existing
                   services or mobile application software, and adds minimal
                   photo storage overhead.",
