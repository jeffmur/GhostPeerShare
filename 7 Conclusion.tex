This work significantly advances the integration of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) in mobile and Flutter applications through the development of the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (FHEL) Plugin and the Distance Measure Plugin. Key contributions include the demonstration of Microsoft SEAL's high performance on mobile devices, effectively handling encrypted computations while maintaining high performance in real-time applications. Deploying these plugins to other Dart projects and Flutter applications enhances their utility and strengthens the privacy and security of mobile software development.
Results reveal that this work achieved high accuracy and consistency in deriving video similarity scores, reinforcing the effectiveness of secure data exchange. It sets a precedent for future FHE applications, especially in critical domains like medical devices, where secure interactions with mobile applications can enhance patient privacy and data integrity. Additionally, mobile FHE applications can seamlessly interact with encrypted data from cloud service providers, opening new avenues for secure data handling. Ultimately, these findings underscore the importance of FHE in modern mobile applications and lay the groundwork for future innovations prioritizing user privacy and security.
