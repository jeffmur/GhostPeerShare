\section{Stakeholders}
Microsoft pioneered the Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) research and led the development of the Simple Encryption Arithmetic Library (SEAL) in 2018. SEAL established a foundation for efficient homomorphic encryption, which made it accessible to the open-source community of security researchers and developers. SEAL was one of several libraries within the homomorphic encryption open-source community. Other libraries in this field included Homomorphic Encryption library (HELib) [2] and Privacy-Preserving Approximate Secure Computation for Encrypted Data (PALISADE) [3]. Collectively, the open-source community aimed to combine the libraries into OpenFHE. A flexible, community-driven project that was initially released in 2020. OpenFHE offers additional support for encryption schemes for evaluating Boolean circuits and arbitrary functions over larger plaintext spaces using lookup tables. Currently, developers and security researchers are limited to developing Fully Homomorphic Encryption applications within C and C++ domains.

Flutter, a state-of-the-art framework by Google captured 46\% of the cross-platform application market [4]. This framework is built on top of Dart, a programming language recognized for its high-performance and plugin system. The Foreign Function Interface (FFI), a Dart plugin, enables seamless integration with C libraries, offering null safety, managed memory, and compatibility across all operating systems, specifically Android, Linux, macOS, iOS and Windows. Currently, Flutter and Dart developers are unable to access Fully Homomorphic Encryption libraries.
