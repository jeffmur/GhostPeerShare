\section{Problem Statement}
The Microsoft Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library (SEAL) [1] requires a strong foundation in both C++ and Fully Homomorphic Encryption principles, creating a steep learning curve for new users. These technical prerequisites have limited the accessibility of SEAL, posing a significant barrier to adoption within the cross-platform development community and hindering broader implementation of advanced encryption protocols in mobile applications.
