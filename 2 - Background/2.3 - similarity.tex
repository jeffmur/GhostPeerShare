\section{Distance Measures}

To accurately measure the similarity between videos while preserving privacy, this project utilizes Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD), Bhattacharyya Coefficient (BC), and Cramer’s Distance (CD). KLD (Kullback and Leibler 1951) is a non-symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. BC (Bhattacharyya 1946) is a symmetric measure of the overlap between two probability distributions. CD (Cramér 1928) is a symmetric measure of the difference between two probability distributions. Following the work of Pop-Share (Lagesse et al. 2021), which established these measures as effective baselines for video similarity analysis. These three metrics were chosen over other probability distribution algorithms due to their reliance on basic arithmetic for homomorphic computations.
