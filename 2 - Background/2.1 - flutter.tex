\section{Flutter}

To support Android and Linux operating systems, Flutter is a modern, open-source framework designed to build natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop using a single codebase. Written in Dart, an object-oriented language with C-style syntax, it includes advanced features like garbage collection for memory management, synchronous and asynchronous handlers, null safety, and compile-time data type checking. We selected Flutter for its low development cost and Foreign Function Interface (FFI), a Dart plugin that allows the application to invoke functions from pre-compiled C libraries. Flutter and Dart are unique, in that, there are no direct alternatives, rather a collection of languages and frameworks to achieve a similar implementation, such as React Native and JavaScript or Kotlin or Swift. Each language has its own distinct compilation methods, so Flutter and Dart is a suitable choice for this project.
