\section{Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library}

To perform computations on encrypted data, this project utilizes Microsoft SEAL (“Microsoft SEAL (Release 4.1)” 2023), an open-source homomorphic encryption library. The library supports limited arithmetic including addition, subtraction, and multiplication to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. We chose Microsoft SEAL primarily for its maturity and widespread use, ensuring readily available cryptosystems and ease of implementation. Additionally, SEAL's optimized performance makes it suitable for practical applications, and its open-source nature guarantees transparency and auditability, which are essential for security-sensitive applications. While other libraries like OpenFHE (Al Badawi et al. 2022) offer similar fully homomorphic encryption capabilities, SEAL provides a good balance of stability and performance, making it a suitable choice for this project.
