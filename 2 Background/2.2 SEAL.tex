\section{Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library}

To perform computations on encrypted data, this project utilizes Microsoft SEAL [1], an open-source homomorphic encryption library developed by Microsoft. The library supports limited arithmetic including addition, subtraction, and multiplication to be performed directly on encrypted data without needing to decrypt it first. We chose SEAL primarily for its maturity and prevalent adoption. The contribution of SEAL was a simplified interface supporting multiple encryption schemes, e.g BFV, BGV, and CKKS. In addition, SEAL's optimized performance makes it suitable for practical applications, and its open-source nature guarantees transparency and auditability, which are essential for security-sensitive applications. While OpenFHE [10], offers similar fully homomorphic encryption capabilities, SEAL provides a good balance of stability and performance, making it a suitable choice for this project.
