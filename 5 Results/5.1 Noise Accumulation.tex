\section{Noise Accumulation}

When performing fully homomorphic operations, a small amount of noise is introduced that affects the accuracy of the decrypted distance measure. If too much noise is accumulated, the plaintext cannot be recovered. Figure 1a represents the baseline Mean Error from Pop-Share, compared to our implementation in Table 5.1. For KLD, our implementation introduced twice the amount of noise than the original. For Cramer Distance, our implementation introduced half of the amount of noise than the original. For Bhattacharyya Coefficient, our implementation introduced half of the amount of noise than the original.
