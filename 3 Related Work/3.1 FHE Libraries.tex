\section{Fully Homomorphic Encryption Libraries}
\label{sec:Related FHE Libraries}
Open-Source Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (OpenFHE) \cite{Al_Badawi2022-openFHE}, is a state-of-the-art C++ library born from a merger of Privacy-Preserving Approximate Secure Computation for Encrypted Data (PALISADE) \cite{PALISADE}, Homomorphic Encryption library (HElib) \cite{HElib} and HEAAN \cite{Cheon2017-CKKS}. OpenFHE supports modern schemes and can be configured to use hardware acceleration.

From existing systems, OpenFHE adapted the modular design of PALISADE with the built-in support of Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) \cite{fan2012-bfv}, Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) \cite{brakerski2012-bgv} and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) \cite{Cheon2017-CKKS}. From HElib an efficient homomorphic encryption library primarily focused on BGV and CKKS schemes, pioneered research and early development in this domain. HEAAN was born from a new scheme, CKKS, to support arithmetic operations on approximate numbers while existing libraries could only support integer-based arithmetic.

Compared to SEAL, the OpenFHE library has an actively growing community with modular integrations of existing systems. The documentation and development guides for OpenFHE are frequently updated and comprehensive. However, SEAL is much more established within the research community. Regarding performance, there have not been any peer-reviewed publications directly comparing the performance of Microsoft SEAL and OpenFHE.
