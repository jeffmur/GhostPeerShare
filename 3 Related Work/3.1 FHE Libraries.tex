\section{Fully Homomorphic Encryption Libraries}
\label{sec:Related FHE Libraries}
Open-Source Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (OpenFHE) \cite{Al_Badawi2022-openFHE}, is a state-of-the-art C++ library born from a merger of Privacy-Preserving Approximate Secure Computation for Encrypted Data (PALISADE) \cite{PALISADE}, Homomorphic Encryption library (HElib) \cite{HElib}, and HEAAN \cite{Cheon2017-CKKS}. OpenFHE supports modern, Fully Homomorphic Encryption schemes and can be configured to use hardware acceleration.

From existing systems, OpenFHE adapted the modular design of PALISADE with the built-in support of Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) \cite{fan2012-bfv}, Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan (BGV) \cite{brakerski2012-bgv} and Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song (CKKS) \cite{Cheon2017-CKKS}. From HElib, an efficient homomorphic encryption library primarily focused on BGV and CKKS schemes, pioneering research and early development in this domain. HEAAN was born from a new scheme, CKKS, to support arithmetic operations on approximate numbers, in contrast to existing libraries that could only support integer-based arithmetic.

Unlike SEAL, the OpenFHE library has an actively growing community. The documentation and development guides for OpenFHE are frequently updated and comprehensive. SEAL, however, is much more established within the research community. There have not been any peer-reviewed publications directly comparing the performance of Microsoft SEAL and OpenFHE.
