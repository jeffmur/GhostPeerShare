\section{Fully Homomorphic Encryption Libraries}

Open-Source Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library, OpenFHE [10], is a state-of-the-art C++ library born from a merger of PALISADE, HElib and HEAAN. OpenFHE supports modern schemes and can be configured to use hardware acceleration.

From existing systems, OpenFHE adapted the modular design of PALISADE [3] with the built-in support of BGV, BFV, CKKS and FHEW schemes. From HElib [2] an efficient homomorphic encryption library primarily focused on BGV and CKKS schemes, pioneered research and early development in this domain. HEAAN [11] was integrated to support arithmetic operations on approximate numbers while other schemes only support integer based arithmetic.

Compared to SEAL, OpenFHE library has an actively growing community with modular integrations of existing systems. The documentation and development guides for OpenFHE are much more modern and comprehensive. However, SEAL is much more established within the research community. Regarding performance, there have not been any peer reviewed publications directly comparing the performance of Microsoft SEAL and OpenFHE.
