\section{Stakeholders}
Microsoft was a pioneer in the Fully Homomorphic Encryption research, leading the development of the Simple Encryption Arithmetic Library, SEAL in 2018. SEAL established a foundation for efficient homomorphic encryption, making it accessible for developers and researchers. The open-source community soon contributed to the field with OpenFHE, a flexible, community-driven project that was initially released in 2020. OpenFHE expands upon the capabilities of SEAL, offering a collaborative platform for researchers and developers interested in advancing encryption technology.

Flutter, a versatile and state-of-the-art framework by Google, now captures 46\% of the cross-platform framework market (Vailshery 2024). Recognized for its ability to support high-performance, cross-platform applications, Flutter includes a powerful plugin system with a Foreign Function Interface (FFI). This interface enables seamless integration with C libraries, offering null safety, managed memory, and compatibility across major operating systems, including Android, Linux, macOS, iOS, and Windows.

By leveraging Dart, a more portable programming language, developers and security researchers can interact directly with FHE backend libraries. This integration reduces the complexity of working with SEAL or OpenFHE, allowing developers to rapidly build cross-platform applications with homomorphic encryption capabilities. Furthermore, security researchers can extend the application to support additional C/C++ libraries, broadening the scope of FHE implementations and facilitating wider distribution to end-users.
