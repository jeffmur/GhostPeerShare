\section{Qualitative Analysis}
The modular implementation of the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (FHEL) Plugin represents a significant advancement in Microsoft SEAL, increasing the availability of Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to the mobile community and Linux applications. This plugin integrates Microsoft SEAL, enabling Dart and Flutter developers to leverage advanced cryptographic capabilities, thereby enhancing privacy in mobile applications. The well-structured documentation and user interfaces ensure that developers can navigate the complexities of the tool with ease. Early feedback indicates that the plugin is user-friendly and effective, although there remains potential for further refinements, particularly in supporting additional backend libraries.
The Distance Measure Plugin complements the FHEL Plugin by providing implementations of state-of-the-art statistical measures, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Cramer Distance, and Bhattacharyya Coefficient, as well as their fully homomorphic encryption counterpart to perform computations directly on encrypted data.
This modular architecture facilitates efficient resource management and high performance while allowing for the seamless integration of future cryptographic algorithms. Together, these developments will advance the field of secure data analysis and establish a solid foundation for future innovations, reinforcing the importance of privacy in contemporary applications.
