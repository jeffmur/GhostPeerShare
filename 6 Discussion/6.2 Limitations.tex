\section{Limitations}
The implementation of the Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library (FHEL) Plugin, the Distance Measure Plugin, and the Flutter application faces several limitations that may impact their usability and performance.
A notable limitation is the availability of FFmpeg, which is only supported on Android and iOS. This restriction obstructs our ability to use a consistent video preprocessing library and methods, hindering the direct re-implementation of the approach from Pop-Share. Additionally, while OpenCV has been utilized for certain features, its performance and compatibility may vary across different operating systems, potentially leading to inconsistencies in the application's behavior.
While the plugins incorporate multi-threaded operations to enhance performance, executing these operations on mobile devices may not be optimal. Pre-processing tasks could suffer from the constraints of mobile hardware, resulting in slower performance or increased latency during computations. This limitation can particularly affect real-time processing capabilities when handling large datasets or multiple video streams.
These limitations underscore the need for continuous development and optimization to ensure consistent performance and broader compatibility across various platforms and use cases.
