\section{Future Work}
Expanding the range of statistical measures in the Distance Measure Plugin will allow for a more comprehensive analysis of data similarity, with plans to integrate additional metrics such as Dynamic Time Warping and Jensen-Shannon Divergence.
There is also a clear path toward refining the GhostPeerShare application for production use, involving rigorous testing and performance optimization. Currently focused on Android and Linux, future efforts will target cross-platform support for iOS, macOS, and Windows, broadening accessibility for users. Additionally, enhanced user support and documentation will be developed to assist developers in effectively utilizing the plugins, while ongoing performance optimization will address mobile environment challenges, such as refining multi-threading capabilities and improving memory management. Lastly, actively soliciting and incorporating user feedback will ensure the plugins evolve to meet the needs of their user base, reinforcing their significance in secure data computations and paving the way for future innovations in Fully Homomorphic Encryption within the Flutter and Dart communities.
