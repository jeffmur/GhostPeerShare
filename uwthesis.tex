%    Revised 2020/02/24, added \caption()[]{} option.  No ToC.

%    Revised for version 2015/03/03 of uwthesis.cls
%    Revised, 2016/11/22, for cleanup of sample copyright and title pages
%
%    This document is contained in a single file ONLY because
%    I wanted to be able to distribute it easily.  A real thesis ought
%    to be contained on many files (e.g., one for each chapter, at least).
%
%    To help you identify the files and sections in this large file
%    I use the string '==========' to identify new files.
%
%    To help you ignore the unusual things I do with this sample document
%    I try to use the notation
%

%    special stuff for my document, but you don't need it in your thesis

\chapter{Related Work}

In this chapter, we provide an overview of the current research landscape surrounding Fully Homomorphic Encryption, relevant Video Similarity algorithms, and Proof of Presence Share, which serves as the baseline for our implementation.

\chapter{Design}

GhostPeerShare is comprised of three major components, Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library, written as a Dart plugin, Similarity Score dart plugin, and Video Similarity Flutter application. In this chapter, we provide an in-depth walk through of each component.

% ========== Chapter 5

\chapter{Results}

In this section, we compare our implementation to the foundational contributions of SSO and PPVS. In order to evaluate the accuracy of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library plugin in Dart, we measure the amount of noise generated during encrypted operations. Next, we compare our implementation of our distance measures using the original pre-processed video frames from SSO. Next, we compare the same video from various angles and determine the accuracy of our implementation. Next, we compare the distance measures for similar scenes against different scenes. Finally, we compare the performance across linux and android devices.

\chapter{Where to find the files}
 
The uwthesis class file, {\tt uwthesis.cls}, contains the parameter settings,
macro definitions, and other \TeX nical commands which
allow \LaTeX\ to format a thesis.  
The source to
the document you are reading, {\tt uwthesis.tex},
contains many formatting examples
which you may find useful.
The bibliography database, {\tt uwthesis.bib}, contains instructions
to BibTeX to create and format the bibliography.
You can find the latest of these files on:
