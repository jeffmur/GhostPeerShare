\chapter {Introduction}

This chapter outlines the challenges and limitations of Microsoft's Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library. Next, we identify beneficiaries and major stakeholders within the Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) domain. Finally, we present a modular interface that grants access to FHE functionality on modern mobile applications.

% ========== Chapter 2
 
\chapter{Background}

This section outlines the technologies and methods used in this research. We start with Flutter, an open-source framework for building cross-platform applications, and highlight its benefits for mobile development. Next, we introduce the Simple Encrypted Arithmetic Library and explain the process of performing computations on encrypted data. Finally, we discuss the distance measures used for privacy-preserving video similarity analysis, focusing on Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Bhattacharyya Coefficient, and Cramerâ€™s Distance. We examine the properties and uses of each metric to show their importance in our work.

% ========== Chapter 3
 
\chapter{Related Work}

This section reviews significant advancements in Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and related methodologies relevant to this project. We begin with an overview of existing FHE libraries. Next, we examine the Proof of Presence Share methodology, an innovative application of FHE to compute video similarity. Finally, we discuss alternative video similarity measures.

% ========== Chapter 4
 
\chapter{Design}

The core design principle is modularity, with each component designed to support additional cryptographic libraries and be flexible for future applications. The implementation includes three core components: two Dart plugins and a Flutter application. The Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) Library plugin integrates Microsoft SEAL and delivers FHE arithmetic for the Dart and Flutter communities. The Distance Measure plugin implements Kullback-Leibler Divergence, Cramer Distance, and the Bhattacharyya Coefficient, along with simplified versions of their original algorithms developed for basic FHE arithmetic operations. GhostPeerShare relies on both Dart plugins as a Flutter-based peer-to-peer Pop-Share application. It enables secure video exchange with strong privacy guarantees.

% ========== Chapter 5

\chapter{Results}

In this section, we compare our implementation to the foundational contributions of SSO and Pop-Share. In order to evaluate the accuracy of Fully Homomorphic Encryption Library plugin in Dart, we measure the amount of noise generated during encrypted operations. Next, we compare our implementation of our distance measures using the original pre-processed video frames from SSO. Next, we compare the same video from various angles and determine the accuracy of our implementation. Next, we compare the distance measures for similar scenes against different scenes. Finally, we compare the performance across multiple linux and android devices.
